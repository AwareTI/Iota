Hello,

The code lines of Iota lies in https://github.com/W3CBrasil/Iota,

technologies in use are all open source based and free to use,
except for Google Maps, which is not open-source, but it's free until lot of access.

The application have an API, an website with some javascript, and a administration area working fully with javascript.

API and the backend of the website are written in the same catalyst application.
Catalyst is a framework for building large, fast and stable web apps, and is written in perl 5.

The database is PostgreSQL 9.1+, but should work in PostgreSQL 8.4+ with some checks on the procedures that uses arrays operations.


The part of the API resides in /api/* path, and administration is over /controle (that means "control")
All the URLs diferrent from above shoud be some page of the website.


There are three points to start to understand how the core of the system works:
- indicators are some data you want to visualize, eg: "numbers of born children per 1000 residents"
- variables are the smallest part of your data, eg: "numbers of born children" and "residents"
- each user has your own set of data for each variable.

Then, you can understand these others:
- each variable needs to have a period, like: "dayly", "weekly", "monthly", "yearly"...
- indicators are composed by variables, using a formula (eg: "numbers of born children / (residents / 1000)")
  but [for while] it can only use variables of the same period.
- users are associated with a city, an network and a network is associated with an institute.
  these relations are used to separate the data for the reports, control user access, etc..
  This may be seen diferrent if you only want to use the indicatos with formulas, but this will need a new fork, or a new branch.

The 'production' branch hold the lasted stable version, and is running on http://indicadores.cidadessustentaveis.org.br/prefeitura

'prefeitura' in this case are the institute and the 'cidadessustentaveis' is the network. The list of the cities are based on the network,
and each user can only belong to one institute, so each institute have it's data for the same indicator.

On http://indicadores.cidadessustentaveis.org.br/dados-abertos you can download all [or a part] the data of the application.

The branch 'master' is running on travis (https://travis-ci.org/W3CBrasil/Iota) that tests the code each commit.
It's falling since one project rename, i didn't realise this until now!

There's a database deploy script, and the project deps are described in https://github.com/W3CBrasil/Iota/blob/master/.travis.yml
